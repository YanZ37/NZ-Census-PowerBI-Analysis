# 📊 New Zealand Census Analysis: Population by Birthplace, Age, Qualification & Occupation

## Project Overview

This project presents a **visual and descriptive analysis of New Zealand Census data**, examining how population characteristics vary by:

- birthplace,
- age group,
- highest qualification, and
- occupation.

The analysis focuses on **changes over time (2013, 2018, 2023)** and highlights differences between:
- New Zealand–born population, and
- major overseas-born groups (Asian-born, UK & Ireland–born, Pacific-born).

## Purpose & Policy Relevance

This project is designed to demonstrate **applied demographic and workforce analysis** using official census data.  
It addresses questions relevant to:

- labour-market and workforce planning,
- migration and settlement analysis,
- skills and qualification distribution,
- population ageing and structural change.

The dashboard is structured for **briefing, exploration, and high-level insight**, rather than technical modelling.

## Key Questions Explored

- How does population growth differ between **NZ-born and overseas-born groups**?
- How do **age structures** vary across birthplace groups?
- What shifts are occurring in **highest qualification attainment** over time?
- How are different population groups distributed across **occupation categories**?
- Are there signs of **upskilling or occupational polarisation**?

## Data Source

- **Statistics New Zealand – Census data (2013, 2018, 2023)**

⚠️ **Data notes:**
- Data is aggregated and descriptive
- Census variables are self-reported
- Results reflect census classification systems and timing

## Dashboard Structure

The dashboard is organised by population group:

### 1. New Zealand–Born Population
- Age distribution and workforce composition
- Changes in highest qualification levels
- Occupational structure and shifts over time

### 2. Overseas–Born New Zealanders
- Overall growth in overseas-born population
- Birthplace composition and regional origins
- Age profile of the working-age population

### 3. Asian–Born New Zealanders
- Rapid population growth between 2013 and 2023
- Strong increase in degree and Level 7+ qualifications
- Growing representation in high-skilled occupations

### 4. UK & Ireland–Born New Zealanders
- Stable population size with ageing profile
- High concentration in professional occupations
- Relatively stable qualification distribution

### 5. Pacific–Born New Zealanders
- Steady population growth
- Younger age structure
- Gradual upskilling alongside continued concentration in labour-intensive occupations

Each section combines **charts, summary metrics, and annotations** to support interpretation.

## Methods & Approach

- Census data aggregation and validation
- Comparative analysis across census years
- Visual encoding optimised for clarity and accessibility
- Narrative annotations to support non-technical users

The focus is on **interpretation and insight**, not causal inference.
